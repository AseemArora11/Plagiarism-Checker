<h1>Plagiarism Checker</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This Python script compares two text files to determine their similarity percentage, helping to identify potential plagiarism. It preprocesses the text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out stopwords using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The comparison is based on the ratio of matching sequences calculated using the SequenceMatcher from the difflib library.
